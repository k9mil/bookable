# bookable

We built bookable, an AI-powered consultation platform that transforms rough client ideas into comprehensive _Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)_ through conversational AI.

Through our combined experiences at software agencies, we knew that converting leads was an expensive and timesinking task. Our research uncovered that:

- 9/10 leads don't convert
- 80% of clients donâ€™t know what they want
- 4 hours is spent on each client, on average

Which is why we built bookable. After reaching out to 170+ freelancers throughout the hackathon, we even got some on our waitlist.
